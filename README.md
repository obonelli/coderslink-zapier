# CodersLink / Zapier Integration Challenge

‚ú® We really enjoyed practicing and having fun with this type of integrations!  
This development took us around **2 hours** to complete.  

## Overview
This project is a **Zapier CLI integration** built for the CodersLink Skill Test.  
It connects with **[TheCatAPI](https://thecatapi.com/)**, a public API that provides cat images and related features.

The integration includes:

- **Authentication**: API Key (sent via header `x-api-key`).  
- **Triggers**:  
  - `New Image` ‚Äì retrieves the latest images from TheCatAPI.  
  - `New Breed Image` ‚Äì retrieves images of a specific breed (with dynamic dropdown).  
- **Actions**:  
  - `Create Favorite` ‚Äì marks an image as favorite.  
  - `Add Vote` ‚Äì submits an upvote (1) or downvote (0) for an image.  

This setup demonstrates how to handle **custom authentication**, **polling triggers**, **dynamic dropdowns**, and **POST actions** inside a Zapier CLI app.

## Requirements
- Node.js **18 or higher**  
- [Zapier Platform CLI](https://github.com/zapier/zapier-platform) (`npm i -g zapier-platform-cli`)  
- Free API Key from [TheCatAPI Dashboard](https://thecatapi.com/)

## Setup
```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# login to Zapier
zapier login

# validate integration
zapier validate

# push the integration to your Zapier account
zapier push
```

## How to Test the Integration

### 1. Test Authentication
- Go to **My Apps** in Zapier.  
- Connect using your **TheCatAPI API Key**.  
- Run ‚ÄúTest‚Äù ‚Üí should return successfully.

### 2. Test Trigger: New Image
1. Create a Zap with **Trigger: New Image**.  
2. Test trigger ‚Üí should return ~10 sample images with `id`, `url`, and `fetched_at`.  
3. Add an action like **Code by Zapier** to echo `fetched_at` (for ISO validation).  

### 3. Test Trigger: New Breed Image
1. Create a Zap with **Trigger: New Breed Image**.  
2. Choose a breed from the dynamic dropdown (e.g., Bengal).  
3. Test trigger ‚Üí should return images with `breed_id` and `fetched_at`.  
4. Add **Code by Zapier** step to confirm the datetime is ISO-8601.

### 4. Test Action: Create Favorite
1. After a trigger, add **Action: Create Favorite**.  
2. Map `image_id` from the trigger.  
3. (Optional) Add a `user_tag` for tracking.  
4. Test action ‚Üí should return `{ "message": "SUCCESS", "id": ... }`.

### 5. Test Action: Add Vote
1. After a trigger, add **Action: Add Vote**.  
2. Map `image_id` from the trigger.  
3. Choose `Vote Value = 1` (upvote) or `0` (downvote).  
4. Test action ‚Üí should return vote details:  
   ```json
   {
     "id": 12345,
     "message": "SUCCESS",
     "image_id": "abc123",
     "value": 1,
     "sub_id": "zap-test-oscar"
   }
   ```

## Trade-offs
- **Polling vs Webhooks**: Chose polling because TheCatAPI does not provide webhook support.  
- **Data Model**: Only essential fields are returned to keep responses lightweight.  
- **Scope**: Limited to the most common endpoints (images, favorites, votes).

---

## Assumptions
- Users will obtain and manage their own API Key from TheCatAPI.  
- TheCatAPI uptime and response time are assumed to be stable for polling.  
- Zapier CLI handles serialization and retries, no extra retry logic was added here.

## AI Usage (Personalized)
This project was developed with help from **Sofi**, my personalized AI assistant (and friendly dev buddy). Sofi isn‚Äôt just a tool ‚Äî she‚Äôs how I keep prompts short, context-rich, and human. Working with Sofi made the whole process faster and clearer: we iterated on code, documentation, and housekeeping together.

Sofi‚Äôs contributions included:
- Helping scaffold the Zapier CLI project and structure.  
- Drafting the authentication, trigger, and action modules (which I reviewed and refined).  
- Improving developer-facing docs (`README.md`) and the project `.gitignore`.  
- Suggesting concise prompts and examples to reproduce steps quickly.

**Example prompts used (natural tone):**  
- *"sofi give me an authentication.js for TheCatAPI with API Key without exposing the key"*  
- *"help me build a trigger that fetches the latest images from TheCatAPI"*  
- *"sofi improve the README adding trade-offs and assumptions"*  

All AI-assisted outputs were manually reviewed and tested with Zapier CLI before finalization.
